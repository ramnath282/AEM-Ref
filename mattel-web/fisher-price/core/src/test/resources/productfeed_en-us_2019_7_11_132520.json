There's also plenty of room on the deck and inside the base to store over 50 Thomas &amp; Friends™ engines! Just drop down the doors for easy storage. Includes 3 train engines: Thomas (TrackMaster™ die-cast push-along), Nia™ (Thomas &amp; Friends ™ MINIS), and Percy (Thomas &amp; Friends™ MINIS). Use the included track pieces to race train engines down the ramp, and attach to other Thomas &amp; Friends™ sets (other engines and sets sold separately). With over 35 pieces, you can create up to four track layouts. There's even a removable helipad for Harold the helicopter (sold separately) that doubles as a track riser! Track pieces work with Thomas &amp; Friends™ TrackMaster™, MINIS and Wood engines. The perfect companion toy to the Thomas &amp; Friends™ Super Station™!​​",

Night has fallen, but that can't stop a very important dockside delivery from being completed. Luckily, this is Hyper Glow Thomas on the job, leaving a trail of light behind as he lights up the tracks! This TrackMaster™ train set from Fisher-Price features two Thomas &amp; Friends™ characters, a full track layout with glowing track, and plenty of cool action! Start by loading the cargo piece in the delivery hopper. Send motorized Thomas and his cargo car racing through, and when they pass beneath the hopper, the cargo drops into the cargo car! As Thomas continues on his way, Cranky will use his hook to grab the cargo. Featuring lights that charge glow-in-the-dark TrackMaster™ track, Hyper Glow train engines have lights on the bottom that charge glow-in-the-dark track, so when they pass over, they leave a glowing trail behind. Plus, they take on a multicolor, glow-in-the-dark look for an even more exciting playtime experience. Also includes a glow in the dark cargo piece.",

The revamped track connectors fit together easily, allowing children to build their own layouts and their own stories by themselves. With this unique connector design, there's no wrong way to build! Plus, the Lift &amp; Load Cargo Set comes with two track adaptors that are compatible with other wood track systems, including classic Thomas &amp; Friends™ Wooden Railway (sold separately and subject to availability). Featuring Charlie, two Troublesome Trucks, a crane operator figure, and two cargo pieces, this set provides endless inspiration for amazing kid-crafted tales. Children can seat the crane operator in the sliding transfer crane, then use it to lift and lower cargo. A separate overhead loader also lets kids drop the cargo pieces into the Troublesome Trucks. And choosing which track to take is as easy as turning the knob on the 4-way crossing.
