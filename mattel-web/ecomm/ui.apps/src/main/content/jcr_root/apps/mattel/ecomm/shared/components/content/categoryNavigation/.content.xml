    jcr:description="This navigation shows links grouped into separate categories. Each category displays as a single column with a descriptive title header, followed below by links, and finally a &quot;View All&quot; link if the total number of links exceeds the max of 10. Authors can format the nav to display 1-4 columns plus optional featured links which display on their own in a left rail. Also available are promo images which can display as one vertical promo image or 2 images stacked."
